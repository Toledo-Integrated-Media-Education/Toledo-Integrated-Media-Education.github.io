        We live in a time of great transition. Many independent media outlets face closing their doors or being absorbed by large conglomerates. At the same time, the Internet has opened up new, more personal avenues to relay information, fundamentally changing the way we share news and keep abreast of what is happening in our cities.

        It is in light of these changes that We Act Media was born. We Act is an up-and-coming multimedia news outlet launching soon in Toledo, Ohio committed to bringing a culture of positive engagement to the local media landscape by helping our audience become participants - not just observers - of the community they live in.

        We Act and its parent organization, Toledo Integrated Media Education, are preparing to launch their first major effort in the Spring of 2016. WAKT-LP, a community-run radio station, has been cleared for operation on 106.1FM and will be our flagship enterprise.
